- how is the spanish verb tardar and buenas tardes related ?

The Spanish verb tardar (to delay/take a long time) and the phrase buenas tardes (good afternoon/evening) are directly related through their common etymological root, the Latin word tardus, meaning "slow," "late," or "sluggish".

Here is how they are connected:

1. Common Etymology (Tardus)
Tardar (Verb): Comes from the Latin tardāre, which means "to delay," "to linger," or "to be slow".
Tarde/Tardes (Noun/Adverb): Comes from the Latin tardē (adv. "slowly/late"), derived from tardus.
2. Conceptual Link: Time
Tardar: Refers to an action that takes a long time, often meaning "to be late" (e.g., No tardaré - I won't be long).
Tarde: Represents the "late" part of the day, which in many cultures (including Spanish) is considered the time when the day is slowing down or concluding.
3. "Buenas Tardes" Usage
Tardes is the plural of tarde (afternoon/evening).
Buenas tardes is a set greeting used from roughly 12:00 PM until sunset (or sometimes 9:00 PM).

The connection lies in the notion that afternoon is the "late" part of the day, using the root of "slowness" or "lateness" to define the time period.
In summary: Tardar is the verb for "being late/taking time," while buenas tardes describes the "late" part of the day. They both descend from the Latin concept of being slow (tardus).
