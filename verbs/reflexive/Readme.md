Acordarse requires the preposition de because it's a pronominal verb (reflexive in structure) that means "to remember" by recalling something to oneself, so the 'se' (self) is connected to the memory via 'de', similar to "remember of" in English, but it's a fixed Spanish construction meaning "to recall from one's memory". You use acordarse de algo (to remember something) or acordarse de que (to remember that), with recordar being the non-reflexive alternative that takes a direct object without a preposition.

#### Why it's structured this way:

- Reflexive Nature: Acordarse is inherently reflexive, meaning the action reflects back on the subject (e.g., me acuerdo, te acuerdas), indicating you're remembering within yourself.
- The Role of "de": The preposition de acts as the bridge, connecting the reflexive verb to the thing being remembered, essentially saying "to remember of something" or "to call to oneself of something".
- Contrast with Recordar: The verb recordar (without se) means "to remember" or "to remind" and functions as a regular transitive verb, taking a direct object without de (e.g., Recuerdo la película - I remember the movie).

#### Examples:

- ¿Te acuerdas de tu primer amor? (Do you remember your first love?)
- Me acuerdo de que teníamos una reunión. (I remember that we had a meeting.)
- Nunca me acuerdo de su cumpleaños. (I never remember his/her birthday.)
