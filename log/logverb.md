I want to be able to track the last time I studied a particular verb.
The spanish language is all about knowing the verbs and how to conjugate
them not to mention knowing the meaning of the word and being able to
translate to the spanish verb when you are speaking.

So this will continue to be my journey as long as I am studying this language :)
