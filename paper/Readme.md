### Little Paper

These are all my little papers in digital form.  Eventually if I get excited
I can make a printout of this stuff...

This is different than the log folder in subtle ways in the fact that this
is literaly papers that I have in my pocket and then later on I add them to
this directory structure.

Whereas log is all about in real time noting new stuff that I am learning
in the flow of thinking and studying.

Note that there can be a copy of log in the actual more related content
directories...

- [log](./../log)
