### buena vs bien

In the phrase "todo bien," bien is an adverb meaning "well" or "fine". It modifies the implicit verb (as in "todo está bien") or describes a state or manner.

- Adverb: "Bien" modifies verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, telling you how something is done. For example, "Ella canta bien" (She sings well).
- In "todo bien": The phrase is a shortened version of "todo está bien," where "bien" describes the state of "everything".
- Distinction from "bueno": "Bien" is often confused with "bueno," which is an adjective meaning "good." Adjectives must agree in gender and number with the noun they describe, while "bien" does not change its form.
