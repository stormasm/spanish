The subjunctive mood is used in `no mires el mercado de valores esta semana` because it is a negative command or prohibition.

In Spanish, the subjunctive mood is used for commands (imperative mood) when they are in the negative form (e.g., "do not look").

### Why the Subjunctive is Used for Negative Commands

The primary function of the subjunctive mood in Spanish is to express subjectivity, uncertainty, desires, doubts, or unreality, as opposed to the indicative mood which is used for objective facts and certainties.

- Commands vs. Suggestions: The imperative mood is used for direct, affirmative commands. However, when the command is a prohibition (a "do not" instruction), it is treated as an expression of desire, will, or recommendation on the speaker's part for an action that has not yet occurred (or might not occur), which requires the subjunctive mood.
- Uncertainty/Hypothetical Nature: When you tell someone not to do something, you are describing an action that is not a concrete reality, but rather a desired non-occurrence.
- Grammatical Rule: As a standard Spanish grammar rule, negative tú commands (and all formal usted / ustedes commands, both affirmative and negative) use the present subjunctive form of the verb.

### Summary of Subjunctive Uses

The use of the subjunctive is often summarized by the acronym WEIRDO:

- Wishes, desires, and wants
- Emotions and feelings
- Impersonal expressions (e.g., es importante que, es posible que)
- Recommendations and requests
- Doubt and denial
- Order/commands (specifically negative commands and formal commands)
